# Modding Tutorials (WIP)

This repository holds the website for my series of modding tutorials.

The tutorials are intended to be different from a conventional wiki as they are
designed to be followed in order, eventually to produce a fully fleshed-out mod
that the user has customised along the way. However, these tutorials can still
be used in a standalone fashion.

## Credits

The idea of a fully functioning and compiling mod that is used by the wiki, and
the region system was inspired by [QuiltMC](https://quiltmc.org)'s wiki system,
although none of their code is/was used.
